# title
(change this if you want i just wanted to put a rough thing together for everyone to look at)
#### i've already added bootstrap, the static dir and the superuser to this so no need to do it yourselves
## Basic outline of the web app
- home w/ about me
- menu w/ recipes
- contact page (info for restaurant)
- login/registration form
- cookbook page
	- folding section for input form
- review page for recipes

#### Terminal commands to use
- `source ./.venv/bin/activate` - turns on virtual environment so we're all working with the same version of django
	- `deactivate` in terminal will turn it off
- `python manage.py runserver` - turns on web server (use control+c while in terminal to turn off the server)
